SPAW Editor PHP Edition
Version 2.0.3
Release Notes

Thanks to everyone who downloaded and tried SPAW Editor v.2! 
Your feedback was extremely helpful.

We have added a feature to customize predefined colors in colorpicker, 
implemented an optional feature to convert special characters to html entities
like &copy;, &mdash;, etc., and brought back highly requested quick image insert
feature from SPAW 1.x. Fix for an ugly bug when editor wasn't usable over HTTPS 
under Firefox is also included.

Not everything what was planned for this release was implemented but we thought
that these changes are too important to just sit on them while we implement
other features and fixes. 

These are only a few of the many changes in the 2.0.3 release. For a complete
list of changes see changelog.txt 

---
This release includes English, Lithuanian, Russian, Hungarian and Dutch language
files updated for version 2. Other language files were ported from version 1.
This means that some of the messages will appear in English instead of the
language of a specific language file. In case you are fluent in any language
that wasn't updated for version 2, we would really appreciate if you could invest
a little of your time to bring these files up to date.

We will post all the updates in our blog at http://blog.solmetra.com
